// In main.js, write a function, changeColor(),that does what you did in svg.css via JavaScript instead. 
// Complete the changeColor() function here, 
// which will take as arguments the id of a path (country) and a fill color. 
// This will come in handy since most visualizations will want to color countries on-the-fly.

// Then make sure your changeColor() function works by calling the function on 4 countries (different than those you have changed via CSS) 
// when the page loads. Make sure that these colors are different than those you have changed via CSS.
