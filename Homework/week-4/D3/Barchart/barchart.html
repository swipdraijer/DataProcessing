		<h1>Brain-to-Body Mass Ratios for 62 Species of Land Mammals</h1>
		<left><svg class="chart"></svg></left>
		<p><br> This figure shows ratios of brain mass to body mass. It becomes clear that small mammals such as the ground squirrel, owl monkey and lesser short-tailed shrew have relatively large brains whereas large mammals such as the African elephant, cow and pig have relatively small brains. Interestingly, humans have large brains in relation to their body weight: the relative size of the human brains outranks the relative size of brains of clearly smaller mammals such as the mouse, the arctic fox and the big brown bat. Ratios can be sorted from high to low by checking the box at the top left.</br> </p>
